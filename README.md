# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game - .NET MAUI

## Overview

A fun little **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game I built using **.NET MAUI**! ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è

I was curious about making a cross-platform app that works on both mobile _and_ desktop. So, I decided to take an old game UI I had built before and reimagine it using **MAUI** ‚Äî with a bit of help from AI. üòÑ  
You can check out the previous version of the game UI here: [Old UI](https://asmaa-elfatayry.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-Challenges/advanced/rock-paper-scissors-master/)

This is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built using **.NET MAUI** (Multi-platform App UI), designed to be cross-platform and run on **Android**, **iOS**, and **Windows**. The app was created as a fun personal project and a break from my main work in **.NET** development. It showcases the power of **.NET MAUI** for building cross-platform apps that can be used on both mobile devices and laptops.

It‚Äôs just a small project I worked on for fun as a break from my serious work, and also to explore app publishing on Windows, Android, and iOS.

## Project Description

The app allows you to play the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game with a randomly chosen opponent. It is developed using **.NET MAUI**, which makes it easy to deploy and run on multiple platforms such as Windows, Android, and iOS. The game provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for players to choose their move and see the outcome of the game.
